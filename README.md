## FAQ
I can not see "Most Popular" and "You May Like" slider contents
- It is because you don't have enough product to display. At least have 10 products added then you will see it.
If I change my product image, I still see the old one.
- Since the new image is saved on server with same file name as the old one, and your web browser is showing the old image from cache, you will not see the new image unless you are seeing it from another web browser or you cleared the cache.
